Concepts Learned

- How to find good initial learning rate by experimenting
- Plotting stats of training
- creating basic embedding from characters
- Building a multi layer perceptron with hidden layers, hyperparameters
- train, dev, test split of dataset
- batching big datasets for training
- how to interpret training stats
- Ways to improve model by increasing parameter size, increasing size of tensors representing embeddings, using variable learning rates for different phases of the training
